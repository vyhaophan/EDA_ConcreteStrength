# EDA_ConcreteStrength
This project consists of an EDA process and a regression model for the Super Concrete dataset.

This is my first analysis project in my university. Here is the components of this project:

1.   My team collect the data here [Concrete Compressive Strength Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Concrete+Compressive+Strength). This dataset has 9 attributes and 1,030 data instances. All of them are real numbers. For more details, please view files [Concrete_Data.xls](https://github.com/vyhaophan/EDA_ConcreteStrength/blob/main/Concrete_Data.xls) and [Presentation Concrete.pptx](https://github.com/vyhaophan/EDA_ConcreteStrength/blob/main/Concrete.pptx).
2.   Split *Concrete_Data.xls* into *Train.csv* and *Test.csv*.
3. Visualize data into histogram, box plot, hexbin chart using GGplot.
4. Use Recursive Feature Elimination algorithm (random forest selection function in core) to get the most 5 meaningful features.
5. Anova analysis 5 times.
6. Build a simple regression model, a regression model with interactions.
7. Evaluate models.
8. Source code for all this can be found at [R_EDA_and_regression.R](https://github.com/vyhaophan/EDA_ConcreteStrength/blob/main/R_EDA_and_regression.R)
